Forms a physical platform to recruit other factors to the DNA including those involved in DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and DNA replication. RPA protects against inappropriate telomere recombination, and upon telomere uncapping, prevents cell proliferation by a checkpoint-independent pathway. RPA prevents degradation of ssDNA and prevents formation of secondary structures. 	RPA can associate with ssDNA in different modalities; a low affinity mode which binds 8–12 nucleotides (nts) and a high-affinity compact mode involving four major DBDs from RFA1 and RFA2 that bends a 28 nts ssDNA tract into a horse-shoe shaped configuration. RFA33 is thought to provide a structural role within the complex. Multiple RPAs may assemble on ssDNA and form higher order assemblies that modulate its function.

Binding of ESCRT-III subunits DID2 (P69771) or VPS60 (Q03390) to the amino-terminal of VTA1 relieves autoinhibition within VTA1 to further enhance stimulation of VPS4 ATP hydrolysis. Binding of IST1 (P53843) to VPS4 negatively regulates VPS4 activity by blocking binding to the ESCRT machinery.	Soluble, catalytically inactive dimers or hexamers oligomerise upon interaction of its MIT domain with ESCRT-III MIM1 and/or MIM2 domains forming two stacked hexameric or heptameric rings with a central pore through which ESCRT-III substrates are translocated in an ATP-dependent manner.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P52917(0)

Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, imported into mitochondria, sorted to one of the four submitochondrial compartments, where they function, and attain their functional native conformation, which is often facilitated by assembly into the membrane or a multiprotein complex. The holo TOM complex contains two or three pores, each of which has a diameter of approximately 20A. When translocation by the TOM complex is coupled with that by the TIM23 or TIM22 complex, the TOM channel can operate as a passive pore to allow passage of the polypeptide segment, which is `pulled' by the TIM complex with the aid of differenial membrane potential and/or ATP. When translocation is uncoupled from the inner-membrane translocators, the TOM complex uses both the stop-transfer pathway, which consists of two steps, the first requiring a membrane potential and an ATP-dependent chaperone mHsp70, and a second mechanism involving the folding of an N-terminal domain that has already crossed the outer membrane and can function as a trap in the intermembrane space to drive translocation of the C-terminal part of the protein by a Brownian ratchet mechanism.

Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase pumps protons into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase). The low potential chain consists of two cyt b hemes, which serve as a pathway through which electrons are transferred across the coupling membrane.

RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3-prime end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3-prime to 5-prime orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process. Two different exosomes exist in yeast, one found in the nucleus and nucleolus (this complex), the other form is lacking the RRP6 subunit and is found in the cytosol (CPX-603). The nuclear/nucleolar RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as upstream antisense RNA species (uaRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3′ end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly also involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin and transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes.

Exo-9 has no exoribonuclease activity but facilitates the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis and serves as a scaffold for the association with the catalytic subunits. Full ribonuclease activity is only achieved when DIS3 (RRP44) and RRP6 bind to the base of Exo-9 and to its cap-side, respectively.

In co-translational targeting of membrane and secretory proteins, SRP recognizes signal sequences as soon as they emerge from the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel and binds to the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC), leading to retardation of peptide elongation. The SRP-RNC complex is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by interaction with the SRP receptor (SR). After docking to the membrane, the RNC is transferred to the protein-conducting channel, the translocon, and protein synthesis continues. The SRP-SR complex dissociates from the ribosome and, as a result of GTP hydrolysis, SRP and SR dissociate from each other. GTP binding to both SRP and SR is required for SRP-SR complex formation. Signal sequence binding and GTP-dependent interaction with SR are mediated by the SRP54 subunit, a multidomain protein with an N-terminal four-helix bundle (N domain), a central GTPase domain (G domain) and a C-terminal methionine-rich domain (M domain). The N-terminal domain (SRP54N) is tightly associated with the G domain (SRP54NG) and may be involved in regulating GTP affinity. The genes encoding scR1 and SRP54p are not essential for growth, although SRP-deficient cells grow poorly, suggesting that an alternative, SRP-independent targeting pathway(s) to the ER membrane exists.

Binds to a 21-base pair DNA sequence, the haploid-specific gene (hsg) operator, to repress transcription of haploid-specific genes and of MATALPHA1 (P0CY06). 	Both MATA1 and MATALPHA2 contain C-terminal homeodomains each of which comprises of three alpha-helices connected by short peptides. The third homeodomain makes specific contacts with nucleotides in the major groove of the DNA duplex, thus determining DNA binding specificity. The MATA1 and MATALPHA2 homeodomains bind in a head-to-tail orientation, with heterodimer contacts mediated by a 16-residue tail located carboxyl-terminal to the MATALPHA2 homeodomain. This tail becomes ordered in the presence of MATA1, part of it forming a short amphipathic helix that packs against the MATA1 homeodomain between helices 1 and 2. A pronounced 60 degree bend is induced in the DNA.	Heterodimer	-	-	-	-	The reference sequence for yeast is from strain S288c, which is a MAT alpha haploid.

May also exist as a dimer in vivo. Purified APC forms dimers in vitro, which have enhanced processivity.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P09798(0)|P14724(0)|P16522(0)|P38042(0)|P40577(0)|P50082(0)|P53068(0)|P53886(0)|Q04601(0)|Q08683(0)|Q12107(0)|Q12157(0)|Q12379(0)|Q12440(0)

The unstable TCA intermediate is synthesised from ATP, threonine and bicarbonate by the SUA5 (P32579) enzyme. 	The complex forms a linear heteropentameric structure. The active site of KAE1, centered on the conserved metal cluster and containing an ATP binding site, is at the bottom of a crater whose walls are made of KAE1, BUD32, PCC1 and GON7. Residues from KAE1, BUD32 and PCC1 contribute to a positively-charged surface patch around the ATP binding site of KAE1, which may be involved in tRNA binding. Binding to KAE1 appears to maintain BUD32 in an inactive conformation inhibiting its kinase activity.

A DASH-microtubule interface is believed to form, in which extensions from DASH rings reach across a gap between the ring and the microtubule and dock on the microtubule wall. DASH rings spontaneously oligomerize in the presence of microtubules of the mitotic spindle. DASH rings are processivity factors that allow kinetochores to translate along a single microtubule without dissociating. Each DASH ring may contain from 16-30 heterodecamers. The NDC80 complex (CPX-548) can simultaneously bind and bridge across two DASH complex rings through a tripartite interaction, each component of which is regulated by IPL1 kinase (P38991).

The transcriptional activator GAL4 activates a set of enzymatic and regulatory genes by binding to their promoter regions. When galactose is the sole carbon source, the galactose-metabolizing enzymes are expressed at 1000 times their level in glucose. In the absence of galactose, GAL4 activity is repressed by forming a complex with the transcriptional repressor GAL80 (CPX-1044). In the presence of galactose and ATP, the GAL3-GAL80 complex forms, removing GAL80 from the GAL4-activation domain, which is then able to recruit the transcriptional machinery. It is also possible a tripartite complex forms (GAL4-GAL80-GAL3), which counterbalances the effect of GAL80 on GAL4 and allows GAL4 to interact with promoters. GAL3 primarily binds with ATP and galactose in the cytoplasm, then moves into the nucleus to interact with GAL80. A paralogous complex, GAL1-GAL80 (CPX-1043) can also form but appears to have lower activity as a transcriptional inducer of GAL genes. It is possible that GAL3-GAL80 may be involved solely in the short-term response to galactose and GAL1-GAL80 is required for continued expression of the GAL genes. 	The interaction between the two GAL80 occurs largely through the interaction between two large beta-sheets, forming a very extensive dimerization surface. The interaction between the two GAL3 molecules is less extensive and occurs largely through water molecules.The GAL3-GAL80 interaction occurs through a complex network of hydrogen bonds. GAL3 binds galactose and Mg2+-ATP, which induce the closed conformation of the protein and enables GAL80 binding. A 2543 A2 surface area gets buried when a dimer of GAL80 binds the two monomers of GAL3, and an additional 647 A2 is buried due to GAL80-induced GAL3 dimer formation.

The GAL network is a small set of genes that regulates galactose import and metabolism. The transcriptional activator GAL4 activates a set of enzymatic and regulatory genes by binding to their promoter regions. When galactose is the sole carbon source, the galactose-metabolizing enzymes are expressed at 1000 times their level in glucose. In the absence of galactose, GAL4 activity is repressed by forming a complex with the transcriptional repressor GAL80. In the presence of galactose and ATP, the GAL3-GAL80 complex (CPX-1042) forms, removing GAL80 from the GAL4-activation domain, which is then able to recruit the transcriptional machinery. It is also possible a tripartite complex forms (GAL4-GAL80-GAL3), which counterbalances the effect of GAL80 on GAL4 and allows GAL4 to interact with promoters. GAL3 primarily binds with ATP and galactose in the cytoplasm, then moves into the nucleus to interact with GAL80. A paralogous complex, GAL1-GAL80 (CPX-1043) can also form but appears to have lower activity as a transcriptional inducer of GAL genes. It is possible that GAL3-GAL80 may be involved solely in the short-term response to galactose and GAL1-GAL80 is required for continued expression of the GAL genes.	The interaction between the two GAL80 occurs largely through the interaction between two large beta-sheets, forming a very extensive dimerization surface. NAD+ facilitates Gal80 binding to Gal4, while NADP+ destabilizes this interaction and may be the initial trigger for Gal4 activation.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P04386(2)|P04387(2)

The complex cleaves pre-mRNAs, adds a polyadenylate tail, and triggers transcription termination. The 3-prime end of mature mRNAs is generated by a site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of an internal phosphodiester bond of the primary transcript by YSH1. The upstream cleavage product generated is then polyadenylated by PAP1 to form a 50-90 adenosine tail at its 3-prime hydroxyl end, which is required for nuclear export, translation, and stability of mRNA. The downstream cleavage product is rapidly degraded. Cleavage and polyadenylation cycles are regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation of CPF is inhibitory to polyadenylation therefore dephosphorylation of CPF by GLC7 is required to switch the processing complex to one competent for poly(A) addition.	The nuclease, polymerase, and phosphatase activities of the CPF complex are organized into three modules. The poly(A) polymerase module contains five subunits: CFT1, PFS2, PAP1, FLP1, and YTH1 CFT1 forms the core of the complex and is composed of three seven-bladed beta-propellers followed by a C-terminal helical domain. The nuclease module is composed of three subunits (YSH1, CFT2, and MPE1), whereas the phosphatase module contains seven subunits (PTA1, REF2, PTI1, SWD2, GLC7, SSU72, and SYC1).

Yeast undergoes a closed mitosis, and therefore the nucleus and its mitotic spindle must be positioned across the junction between the mother and bud, termed the bud neck, to provide a set of chromosomes to the daughter cell. Dynein anchors to the bud end and becomes activated, allowing force generation between the microtubule and the cortex. The microtubule is pulled to slide along the cortex, causing the spindle to move into the mother-bud neck .Chemical transitions (ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ADP) are coupled to structural changes in the motor, whilst conversely, mechanical events (such as microtubule binding) can influence the rate of chemical transitions.	The dynein complex consists of a dimer heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains. The dynein heavy chain contains an N-terminal dimerization/cargo-binding domain and a C-terminal motor domain consisting of a hexameric array of AAA+ ATPase domains. The extended tail of the heavy chain binds to the intermediate (PAC11), light intermediate (DYN3) and light chain (DYN2) subunits.

The complex is bound directly to the spindle pole body by SPC110 (P32380) on the nuclear face and SPC72 (P39723) on the cytoplasmic face.	Y-shaped, with an elongated body connected to two arms. The body consists of the N-terminal regions of SPC97 and SPC98. The C-terminal regions of SPC97 and SPC98 form the base of each arm of the Y, and TUB4 forms part of a lobe at the end of each arm. Binding of GTP to gamma-tubulin regulates the strength of its interaction with tubulin. The complex then assembles into a single helical turn consisting of 7 gamma-tubulin small complex units, leaving 13 exposed gamma-tubulins, thus allowing 13-protofilament microtubule filaments to template from the complex. The spindle pole body (SPB) consists of a series of stacked layers embedded in the nuclear envelope. The inner plaque is the area where the microtubules dock to the SPB and harbors the gamma-tubulin small complex and the N-terminus of SPC110. The central plaque (CPX-1419) and the Intermediate layer 2 (IL2, CPX-1420) layer are the two core layers. This core is composed of 5 proteins. SPC29 and CMD1 reside in the central plaque. SPC42 is thought to begin within the central plaque, but terminate in the IL2 layer. The C-terminus of SPC110 is in the central plaque where it binds CMD1. The C-terminus of CNM67 lies in the IL2 layer where it binds SPC42 and links the SPB core to the outer plaque. The outer plaque is the cytoplasmic boundary of the SPB where the astral microtubules nucleate from a second region of gamma-tubulin.

Nonsence-mediated decay (NMD) is triggered by the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) context surrounding the translation termination event. NMD targets can be recognized as targets due to the lack of factors bound downstream from the termination codon. A ribosome terminating translation at a termination codon substantially upstream from the poly(A) tail terminates translation inefficiently. NMD may occur because the PAB1 (P04147) or other factor bound to the poly(A) tail is not in close enough proximity to the terminating ribosome to enable interaction of the PAB1 with SUP35 (P05453), which is bound to the terminating ribosome and thus establishes the correct mRNP context for a normal translation termination event. In the absence of correct translation termination, the nonsense-mediated decay complex interacts with the translation release factor ERF1-ERF3 complex (CPX-435), resulting in an aberrant translation termination event and NMD activation. NMD activation leads to the decapping of the mRNA by the decapping complex, DCP1-DCP2 (CPX-1628), followed by 5-prime to 3-prime degradation of the mRNA by the exoribonuclease XRN1 (P22147).	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P30771(0)|P38798(0)|P48412(0)

Before the commencement of replication, the cohesin complex is loaded onto DNA. The arms of the SMC1/3 molecules embrace the DNA, thereby forming a ring of approx. 40 nm diameter. The head domains of SMC1 and SMC3 are locked together by REC8. Cohesion might be generated as the replication fork passes through the ring, entrapping both sister chromatids inside. At the metaphase to anaphase transition, REC8 is cleaved by separase, thereby opening the lock of the SMC1/3 head domains. The ring opens and sister chromatids can be pulled to opposite spindle poles. REC8 is required to efficiently recruit meiotic axis proteins such as RED1 and evenly distribute these along the meiotic chromosomes.

The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. Myosin V has a high duty cycle, i.e. remains attached to actin for a large fraction of the mechanochemical cycle due to the slow rate of ADP release, the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. This kinetic adaptation allows myosin V to take multiple steps without dissociating from the actin filament. Myosin V can take large steps of approximately 36nm, a distance equal to the helical repeat of the actin filament allowing Myosin V to walk in a straight line on the actin filament, in a hand-over-hand fashion.	MYO4 contains an N‐terminal ‘head’ or motor domain, containing the actin‐binding and ATP catalytic sites, followed by an extended ‘neck’ domain formed by six in‐tandem IQ motifs. Following the neck is the ‘tail’ domain, which contains a region predicted to form a coiled‐coil and a C‐terminal globular domain. The IQ motifs constitute the binding sites for Ca2+‐free (or apo) Calmodulin (CaM) and CaM‐like light chains. IQ motifs are approximately 25 amino acids long with the consensus sequence IQxxxRGxxxR. Apo‐CaM is the primary light chain of myosin V, occupying approximately four out of the six IQ sites, however binding of the light chain MLC1 is essential.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P06787(8)|P32492(2)|P53141(4)

Acts as the decoding centre of the ribosome which brings mRNA and aminoacylated transfer (t)RNAs together, with the 16S ribosomal (r)RNA being required for the selection of the cognate tRNA.	Due to genome duplication, believed to have been caused by two different ancestral species mating followed by substantial losses of duplicated genes through degenerative processes, the 33 different proteins of the small ribosomal subunit are encoded by 57 genes. It has been suggested that, for each duplicated gene, one ribosomal protein gene (RPG) may provide most of the expressed transcript needed for growth under normal condition, while the other provides the extra RP protein amounts and/or function needed for optimum growth in response to a changing environment. The core of the 40S subunit is formed by the 18S ribosomal RNA, whilst the ribosomal proteins create binding sites for the mRNA and the tRNA A-site, P-site and E-site. Whilst there is normally considered a single copy of each polymer in the mature ribosome, there is evidence that the composition can vary in response to physiological conditions, potentially altering the translational efficiency of distinct mRNAs.

Responsible for the catalytic activity of the ribosome, the peptidyltransferase activity required to catalyze peptide bond formation. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel.	Due to genome duplication, believed to have been caused by two different ancestral species mating followed by substantial losses of duplicated genes through degenerative processes, the 46 different proteins of the large ribosomal subunit are encoded by 81 genes. It has been suggested that, for each duplicated gene, one ribosomal protein gene (RPG) may provide most of the expressed transcript needed for growth under normal condition, while the other provides the extra RP protein amounts and/or function needed for optimum growth in response to a changing environment. A distinct lateral protuberance called the stalk is located on the large ribosomal subuniit and plays a central role in the ribosome-mediated stimulation of translation factor-dependent GTP hydrolysis. The 5 acidic ribosomal P-proteins form the pentameric stalk.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P02406(1)|P04650(1)|P05317(1)|P05747(1)|P14120(1)|P14126(1)|P26321(1)|P38061(2)|P41805(1)|P49167(1)|[P02400,P05319](1)|[P04449,P24000](1)|[P05318,P10622](1)|[P05737,Q12213](1)|[P05738,P51401](1)|[P05740,P46990](1)|[P05743,P53221](1)|[P05744,P41056](1)|[P05745,O14455](1)|[P05748,P54780](1)|[P0C0W9,Q3E757](1)|[P0C2H6,P0C2H7](1)|[P0C2H8,P0C2H9](1)|[P0CH08](1)|[P0CX23,P0CX24](1)|[P0CX25](1)|[P0CX27](1)|[P0CX41,P0CX42](1)|[P0CX43,P0CX44](1)|[P0CX46,P0CX45](1)|[P0CX50,P0CX49](1)|[P0CX53,P0CX54](1)|[P0CX82,P0CX83](1)|[P0CX84,P0CX85](1)|[P0CX86](1)|[P10664,P49626](1)|[P17076,P29453](1)|[P26784,P26785](1)|[P36105,P38754](1)|[P49166,P51402](1)|[P56628,P05749](1)|[P87262,P40525](1)|[Q02326,P05739](1)|[Q02753,Q12672](1)|[Q12690,P40212](1)

The SSU processome is a giant particle composed of numerous ribosome assembly factors, including the UTP-A (CPX-1409), UTP-B (CPX-1410), UTP-C (CPX-772/CPX-771/CPX-773) and MPP10 (CPX-1893) complexes, the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) and many individual proteins. Acts in the nucleolus to cleave the polycistronic precursor pre-rRNA in the 5-prime external transcribed spacer (ETS) sequence and in the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) sequence, to separate small and large subunit biogenesis. The nascent SSU is then exported from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm, where the final cleavage occurs to form the mature 40S SSU containing the 18S rRNA. The nuclease FCF1 and the molecular motor BMS1 cause structural changes within the mature processome which facilitate the subsequent cleavage reactions.	UTP-A (CPX-1409) forms the base of the SSU processome, where it acts as a central scaffold that recognizes the first three helices of the 5-prime ETS. U3 snoRNA occupies a central position within the SSU processome and reaches from the outside into the core of the particle. By base-pairing with its 5-prime and 3-prime hinges to nucleotides within the 5-prime ETS, it rigidifies the structural scaffold provided by the 5-prime ETS. The 5-prime end of U3 snoRNA reaches further into the center of the SSU processome and base-pairs with two regions of the pre-18S rRNA.

The yeast nucleus contains approximately 200 NPCs per cell and as the sole site of macromolecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm, the complex provides an important control point for the regulation of gene expression. Inert polymers and small proteins less than 9 nm in diameter or less than 30-40 kDa in mass can freely diffuse through the NPC, larger particles traverse the NPC by a facilitated mechanism with the structure able to expand radially to accommodate the passage of larger particles. The nuclear basket subunits play an active role in transcription, transcriptional memory and chromatin organization by recruiting members of the transcription machinery to the nuclear side of the NCP.	The nuclear pore complex has a hollow cylindrical shape with eight-fold rotational symmetry along the axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope with dimensions of 96 nm diameter by 35 nm high in yeast. The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes. Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. Each of the constituent proteins is present in 8-56 copies, with a total of 552 proteins in yeast. The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. There are a total of 32 repeating Y subcomplexes consisting of 7 subunits, NUP133, NUP84, NUP85, NUP120, NUP145C, SEC13 and SEH1. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. The inner ring complex (IRC) consists at least of NUP157, NUP170, NUP188 and NUP192. Anchored to the IRC inside the pore is a FG-NUP-enriched subcomplex composed of NSP1, NIC96, NUP49 and NUP57. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than 30-40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. GLE1, GLE2, NUP42, NUP116 and subcomplex NSP1-NUP82-NUP159-DYN2 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP1, NUP2, NUP60, MLP1 and MLP2 localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket. Nup100 and NUP145N may occur on the cytoplasmic and nuclear side while NSP1 may occur on the cytoplasmic side and the inner channel. NDC1, NUP53, ASM4 (NUP59), POM34 and POM152 are transmembrane NUPs forming the membrane ring subcomplex.

It is involved in multiple membrane fission processes: a) the final step of cell organelle fusion processes such as the biogenesis of intraluminal vesicles (ILV) in multivesicular bodies (MVB, a type of late endosomes), fusion of autophagosomes with MVB or lysosomes and amphisomes or MVB with lysosomes, thereby playing a crucial role in processes like autophagy and downregulation of cell-surface receptors, b) polarity, c) migration, d) miRNA activity, e) mRNA transport, f) repair of plasma membrane wounds, g) the final scission of cytokineses, h) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion, i) nuclear pore complex (NPC) surveillance and j) extraction of defective NPCs. ESCRT-III assembles into a highly ordered filament-like hetero-oligomer, which may spatially restrict membrane-curvature-inducing factors to initiate budding away from the cytoplasm. VPS20 nucleates the homo-oligomerization of SNF7 that is capped by VPS24. VPS24 recruits VPS2, initiates VPS4-dependent ESCRT-III dissasembly and binds phosphatidylinositol 3,5-diphosphate. 	All four ESCRT-III subunits are predicted to share a common domain architecture of four α helices bundled into an N-terminal core domain, followed by an unstructured C-terminal region. The complex architecture relies primarily interactions between its subunits and the endosome. SNF7, VPS24, and VPS2 coassemble into membrane-deforming helices by directly modulating the three-dimensional architecture of SNF7 filaments.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P36095(0)|P36108(0)|P39929(0)|Q04272(0)

Forms inactive dimers whereas initiation-competent Pol I is monomeric. Initiation of transcription requires the assembly of the upstream activating factor (UAF, CPX-1101), the core factor (CPX-1836), the TATA binding protein SPT15, and RNAP-I with RRN3 on the upstream element and core promoter. Upon transcription initiation, UAF, RRN3 and CF dissociate from the promoter.	The polymerase consists of a core element with a central large cleft forming the active center. The clamp element is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. The cleft is surrounded by an upper jaw and a lower jaw. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. The fork loop 1 interacts with the RNA-DNA hybrid, possibly stabilizing it. The active-centre cleft is expanded in comparison to Pol II (CPX-2662) and the catalytic residues in the active site at the bottom of the cleft arranged such that the enzyme is trapped in an inactive conformation. A novel protein element, the `expander', exists inside the active-centre cleft, apparently stabilizing the expanded conformation of the enzyme and occluding the template DNA-binding site. Another novel, Pol I-specific protein element, the `connector', invades the active-centre cleft of a neighbouring Pol I enzyme, leading to the formation of a tightly packed Pol I homodimer. This dimer is predicted to be transcriptionally inactive because the connector and the expander both need to be released from the polymerase to allow promoter DNA loading and RNA production.

ATP binding induces a conformational change in the MSH2-MSH6 (CPX-1037) and MSH2-MSH3 (CPX-1036) complexes which converts these to a clamp form that slides along the DNA and leads to recruitment of MutLalpha (CPX-1666), MutLbeta (CPX-1667) and MLH1-MLH3. Appears to substitute in a minor way MutLalpha, for maintaining the genetic stability of simple sequence repeats, by suppressing recombination between slightly divergent or homeologous DNA sequences, and in the repair of heteroduplex sites present in meiotic recombination intermediates. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P38920(0)|Q12083(0)

This complex is paralogous to the DBF2-MOB1 kinase complex (CPX-1683) and is assumed to have the same functionality however DBF2 (P22204) accounts for the bulk of the activity, with DBF20 playing a minor role.

TIM50 interacts with incoming pre-sequence-carrying pre-proteins as they reach the trans site of the TOM40 complex (CPX-474). Pre-proteins are directed by the intermembrane space-exposed domains of TIM50, and TIM23 to the protein-conducting channel of the TIM23 complex. The pre-sequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) drives the completion of pre-protein translocation into the matrix. In most cases, the pre-sequence is proteolytically removed by the mitochondrial-processing peptidase (CPX-1630).	Translocation is energetically driven by the electrical membrane potential across the inner membrane where they interact with the ATP-bound state of SSC1 (HSP77/mtHSP70). Upon ATP hydrolysis, SSC1 tightly binds the incoming chain and is released from the TIM23 complex. Repeated SSC1-binding cycles drive complete translocation of the precursor protein. SSC1 is finally released upon exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, a reaction stimulated by MGE1 (GRPE). Membrane-bound PAM16-PAM18 (TIM14-TIM16) regulates the ATPase activity of SSC1. This interaction is stabilised by PAM17 which promotes the PAM16-PAM18 association with the presequence translocase. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0486"(UniProt)	P0CS90(0)|P32897(0)|P36147(0)|P38523(0)|P39515(0)|P42949(0)|Q01852(0)|Q02776(0)|Q07914(0)

As newly synthesized proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus they undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation, and are targeted to their appropriate destination in a pH-dependent manner. Membrane-bound ion transporters/proton exchangers use the pH gradient to sequester metal ions to the vacuole and other cellular organelles. The combined action of the V-ATPase and membrane transporters plays a key role in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. The variant of the complex containing the STV1 subunit results in the retention of the V-ATPase complex on Golgi and endosomal membranes. The N-terminal domain of STV1 contains the W83KY sequence, which is necessary and sufficient for targeting the complex to the Golgi apparatus. When yeast cells are deprived of glucose, the V1 and VO regions separate and are no longer able to hydrolyze ATP and transport protons. 	The V-ATPase complex can be functionally separated into two subcomplexes: the V1 domain is a 600-650 kDa peripheral complex involved directly in ATP hydrolysis and the integral membrane V0 domain responsible for the translocation of protons across a membrane bilayer. The membrane-embedded V0 domain is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and is composed of components a, c, c', c'', d, e, f and VOA1 (VPH1 or STV1, VMA3, VMA11, VMA16, VMA6, VMA9, YPR170W-B, VOA1). The soluble V1 domain contains subunits A-H (VMA1, VMA2, VMA5, VMA8, VMA4, VMA7, VMA10, and VMA13) and consists of three catalytic AB heterodimers that form a heterohexamer, three peripheral stalks each consisting of EG heterodimers, one central rotor including subunits D and F, and the regulatory subunits C and H. Sequential ATP hydrolysis by the AB subunits produces conformational changes in the A3B3 hexamer that induce rotation of the central stalk (DFd) and the c-ring (c8c'c'' VOA1). The c, c', and c'' subunits that form the c-ring have conserved glutamate residues on their outer alpha-helices that are required for proton translocation. For every three ATP hydrolysis events, there is one complete rotation of the central stalk and c-ring.

It destabilizes monopolar attachments by phosphorylating key proteins at the kinetophore. The opposing Chromosomal Passenger complex and Glc7 (P32598) activities ensure that chromosomes achieve a bipolar attachment to the spindle. Monopolar attachments do not produce tension across sister kinetochores (and the complex may act by sensing this absence of tension). The Chromosome passenger complex is conserved from yeast to man and is an essential regulator of diverse aspects of mitosis that ensure faithful chromosome segregation. The complex undergoes changes in its localization throughout mitosis: in early mitosis it presumably localizes to chromosome arms while later in metaphase it is found at the centromere. At anaphase onset it re-localizes to mitotic spindle microtubules accumulating in the midbody in late anaphase where it promotes spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. In budding yeast it seems to follow the positive ends of depolimerizing microtubules in late anaphase. It also plays a role in contractile ring formation and regulation of abscission in cytokinesis.	IPL1 binds the N-terminal domain of SLI15, while the C-terminal domain of Sli15 forms a three-helix bundle with the other two regulatory components, BIR1 and NBL1. The size of the complex is about 1.5 MD by gel filtration indicating either elongated shape or oligomerization.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0486"(UniProt)	P38283(0)|P38991(0)|P47134(0)|Q3E7Y6(0)

The myosin heavy chain motor domain mediates the ATP-dependent interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton. The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. Myosin V has a high duty cycle, i.e. remains attached to actin for a large fraction of the mechanochemical cycle due to the slow rate of ADP release, the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. This kinetic adaptation allows myosin V to take multiple steps without dissociating from the actin filament. Myosin V can take large steps of approximately 36nm, a distance equal to the helical repeat of the actin filament allowing Myosin V to walk in a straight line on the actin filament, in a hand-over-hand fashion.	MYO2 contains an N‐terminal ‘head’ or motor domain, containing the actin‐binding and ATP catalytic sites, followed by an extended ‘neck’ domain formed by six in‐tandem IQ motifs. Following the neck is the ‘tail’ domain, which contains a region predicted to form a coiled‐coil and a C‐terminal globular domain. The IQ motifs constitute the binding sites for Ca2+‐free (or apo) Calmodulin (CaM) and CaM‐like light chains. IQ motifs are approximately 25 amino acids long with the consensus sequence IQxxxRGxxxR. Apo‐CaM is the primary light chain of myosin V, occupying approximately four out of the six IQ sites, however binding of the light chain MLC1 is essential.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)	P06787(8)|P19524(2)|P53141(4)

The regulatory particles act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. The base drives the mechanical substrate unfolding and translocation of the unstructured polypeptides into the degradation chamber of the core peptidase. The lid contains the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) RPN11 that cleaves polyubiquitin chains from targeted substrates as an essential step in proteasomal substrate processing.

Synthesizes precursors of mRNAs, and most snRNA and microRNAs. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the mediator complex (CPX-3226) assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition.	Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. The fork loop 1 (RPB2) interacts with the RNA-DNA hybrid, possibly stabilizing it.

Regulates cellular energy metabolism by activating energy-producing pathways and inhibiting energy-consuming processes via derepression of glucose-repressed genes. Required for the diauxic shift, in which genes required for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (normally repressed by glucose) are switched on; growth then resumes at a lower rate. Role in filamentous invasive growth, on glucose depletion, in haploid cells. The activity of this complex is modulated by reversible phosphorylation of SNF1 Thr-210 which increases in response to glucose starvation and correlates with large increases in cellular ADP-to-ATP and AMP-to-ATP ratios. Binding of ADP, but not AMP, to the complex protects against dephosphorylation of Thr-210, suggesting that ADP, rather than AMP, may be the critical activating signal. When glucose levels are high, the complex is cytoplasmic. Upon glucose depletion, SIP2-containing SNF1 remain in the cytosol.	A central component of the heterotrimer interface is an eight-stranded, mostly antiparallel beta-sheet, formed with four strands from SNF1 (residues 531-586), three strands from SIP2 (residues 375-412) and one strand from SNF4 (residues 38-45).

The catalytic activity depends on LCB1 and LCB2, and is stimulated several-fold by TSC3. The remaining components are believed to play regulatory roles. Mature sphingolipids are an essential component of the plasma membrane. Moreover, several intermediates in sphingolipid metabolism are important signaling molecules involved in control of growth and stress response. Tight regulation of this rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis is therefore critical for lipid homeostasis, membrane biogenesis, protein quality control and trafficking through the secretory pathway. Regulation of sphingolipid synthesis is mediated by phosphorylation of ORM1 and ORM2 as well as by up-regulation of ORM2 protein levels. Sphingolipid depletion activates the TORC2 complex (CPX-1717), which triggers ORM1 and ORM2 phosphorylation by the protein kinase YPK1 (P12688). Inhibition of the nutrient-sensitive TORC1 complex (CPX-1715 /CPX-1716) triggers phosphorylation of ORM proteins by the protein kinase NPR1 (P22211). Increased phosphorylation of ORM proteins reduces their inhibitory activity resulting in stimulation of SPOTS and increased sphingolipid synthesis. In addition, the presence of the phosphoinositide phosphatase SAC1 (P32368) in the SPOTS complex appears to link sphingolipid synthesis to phosphoinositide signaling that controls ER functions and ER-to-Golgi traffic. Thus, the SPOTS complex may be responsible for coordinating sphingolipid homeostasis with a variety of processes that control cell growth and response to nutrients.	The presence of closely related gene products LCB1/2 and ORM1/2 suggest several variants of this complex may exist.	-	myriocin (CHEBI:582124)	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"-"(Saccharomyces Genome Database)	P25045(0)|P32368(0)|P40970(0)|P53224(0)|Q06144(0)|Q3E790(0)

This provides a metabolic connection between glycolysis, whose end product is pyruvate, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which starts with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is negatively regulated via phosphorylation of its PDA1 subunit. The protein kinases PKP1 (P40530) and PKP2 (P53170) phosphorylate PDA1, and the protein phosphatases PTC5 (Q12511) and PTC6 (P25646) mediate its dephosphorylation.	Pyruvate dehydrogenase consists of five subunits that are assembled into a huge heteromultimer of 8-9 megadaltons. The core is comprised of 60 copies of LAT1 (also known as E2; dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase) that form a pentagonal dodecahedron. Twelve copies of LDD1 (also known as E3; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) are attached to the LAT1 core via the binding protein PDX1. A variable number of PDA1 and PDB1 (also known as E1 alpha and E1 beta, respectively) subunits bind as heterotetramers to the LAT1 core. In the reaction mediated by the PDH complex, pyruvate becomes covalently linked to the thiamine diphosphate (TPP) cofactor of E1 (PDA1 and PDB1), creating 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP. The alpha-hydroxy group of 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP is subsequently oxidized, creating an acetyl group that becomes bound to the dihydrolipoyllysine group of E2 (LAT1). LAT1 transfers this acetyl group to CoA to generate acetyl-CoA.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"-"(Saccharomyces Genome Database)	P09624(12)|P12695(60)|P16387(24)|P16451(12)|P32473(24)

Ribosome ubiquitination induces subunit dissociation by the RQT complex. Dissociation of the 40S subunits allows binding of 60S ribosome-nascent chains to RQC2, which recruits the LTN1 E3 ubiquitin ligase.

The synthesis of ATP is coupled to the respiratory chain via the proton potential. The ATP synthase is a molecular motor composed of two separable parts: F1 and F0. The F1 portion contains the catalytic sites for ATP synthesis and protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix. F0 forms a proton turbine that is embedded in the inner membrane and connected to the rotor of F1. The flux of protons flowing down a potential gradient powers the rotation of the rotor driving the synthesis of ATP. Thus, the flow of protons though F0 is coupled to the synthesis of ATP. 	Multimeric enzyme complex with an overall molecular weight of about 600,000 Da, consisting of an extra-membranous F1 catalytic domain linked by a central stalk to an intrinsic F0 membrane domain. ATP1 and ATP2 subunits are arranged alternately around a coiled coil of two anti-parallel alpha helices in the ATP3 subunit. The catalytic sites are in the ATP2 subunits at the ATP1/2 subunit interface. The proton pore of the ATP synthase consists of a ring of c subunits (OLI1), which rotates, driven by downhill proton diffusion across the membrane. An essential carboxylate side chain in each subunit provides a proton-binding site.
