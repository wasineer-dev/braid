Strand recognition necessary for removal of DNA biosynthetic errors from the daughter strand is based on the transient absence of d(GATC) methylation in the newly synthesized DNA strand (hemimethylation). Repair is initiated by the binding of mutS to a mismatch or to a small insertion-deletion loop.	MutS binds DNA as a homodimer. After mismatch recognition, MutS exchanges ADP for ATP and undergoes a conformational change to form a sliding clamp on DNA. By interactions via C-terminal domains, the MutS dimers can form tetramers. Tetrameric MutS has a slow dissociation from DNA, which can be due to occasional bending over and binding DNA in its two binding sites. In contrast, the dimer dissociation is faster, primarily dependent on a combination of the type of mismatch and the flanking sequence.

TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. The protein kinase HipA acts as a persistence factor, inducing multi-drug tolerance by triggering growth arrest. HipA activity is inhibited upon binding to HipB through sequestration to the nucleoid and binding to DNA. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176), leaving the toxins to exert their effectsl which result in growth arrest and cell dormancy. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription, with TA complexes repressing transcription more efficiently than the antitoxins alone by increasing the co-operativity of antitoxin binding to operators. Complex formation prevents the protein kinase HipA acting as a persistence factor, inducing multi-drug tolerance by triggering growth arrest. 	In the HipA-HipB-DNA complex, the HipB dimer is sandwiched on each side by one HipA molecule and the complex is formed from noncontiguous regions of both HipA and HipB.

The binding of effector dATP alters the active site to select for pyrimidines over purines, whereas effectors dGTP and TTP select for substrates ADP and GDP, respectively.	The active alpha(2)beta(2) complex has a compact structure that can be reversibly converted via a dynamic conformational rearrangement to an inactive alpha(4)beta(4) state in the presence of elevated deoxyATP. The homodimeric alpha-2 subunit contains the active site, where ribonucleotide reduction occurs, and two types of allosteric effector binding sites. One effector site tunes the specificity for all four ribonucleotide substrates in response to intracellular levels of deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dATP, dTTP, dGTP) and ATP. The second effector site controls the rate of reduction, binding ATP to turn the enzyme on or dATP to turn it off, thus reducing enzyme activity through a negative feedback mechanism. The beta-2 subunit harbors the essential diferric-tyrosyl radical (Tyr-123) co-factor that initiates radical chemistry. The alpha(4)beta(4) complex induced by the negative effector, dATP, is a ring-like structure composed of alternating alpha(2) and beta(2) subunits.

Coupled conformational transitions in fliM trigger large displacements of a distant alpha-helix in fliG, involved in stator complex (CPX-5884) contacts, inducing the change of the flagellar rotors from counter-clockwise (smooth-swimming phenotype) to clockwise rotation (tumbly phenotype). Phosphoryl-cheY binds fliM with approximately 20-fold higher affinity than non-phosphorylated cheY.

TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through TBDTs requires interaction with tonB in complex with exbB and exbD in the inner membrane, ExbBD. tonB undergoes rapid energized movement driven by ExbBD which harvest the electrochemical force from the electrochemical proton gradient created by the proton gradient across the inner membrane and convert it into rotational motion. Hence, tonB may pull or twist the N-termini of TBDTs to promote transport of substrates into the periplasm. ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters subsequently move the cyanocobalamine through the periplasm and inner membrane.	The lumen of btuB, a 22-stranded beta-barrel outer membrane protein, is blocked by an N-terminal plug, or cork, domain preventing passive transit of vitamin B12. The binding of vitamin B12 induces an allosteric rearrangement of the plug domain, releasing a conserved motif, the Ton-box into the periplasmic space, where it forms a 1:1 complex. The transmembrane helix at the N-terminus of TonB forms a complex with exbB and exbD, which is necessary, together with an energized IM, for tonB-dependent transport.

Type II TA complexes are small protein-protein pairs; under growth conditions, the toxin is bound to the antitoxin, which inhibits its activity.

MqsR toxin is the most up-regulated gene in the persister phenotype of cells.

Catecholate transport requires an outer membrane receptor (fecA), which is relatively specific for its ligand. The ligand-bound receptor then physically interacts with the TonB protein. TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through TBDTs requires interaction with TonB in complex with exbB and exbD in the inner membrane, ExbBD. TonB undergoes rapid energized movement driven by ExbBD which harvests the electrochemical force from the electrochemical proton gradient created by the proton gradient across the inner membrane and convert it into rotational motion. Hence, tonB may pull or twist the N-termini of TBDTs to promote transport of substrates into the periplasm. ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters subsequently move the ferric citrate (Fe3+) through the periplasm and inner membrane. 	The lumen of fecA, a 22-stranded beta-barrel outer membrane protein, is blocked by an N-terminal plug, or cork, domain preventing passive transit of ferric citrate.

The complex is comprised of the two enzymes that catalyze the final steps in cysteine biosynthesis. Serine acetyltransferase (CysE) catalyzes an acyl transfer from acetyl-CoA to L-Ser using a random-order kinetic mechanism to form O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS). OAS allosterically regulates CysB (P0A9F3), a transcriptional activator of the cysteine regulon, up-regulating CysB expression by binding to and preventing CysB from binding to its own promoter, where it inhibits transcription. OAS also regulates the balance of the bound and free forms of CysE and CysK by binding to and dissociating the complex. CysK a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, appears to be inactive in the complex, but when active, displaces the acetoxy group from OAS with bisulfide to yield L-Cys. Dissociation therefore stimulates both OAS consumption and cysteine synthesis.	CysE (a dimer of homotrimers) binds a maximum of two molecules of CysK (a dimer) in an interaction believed to involve docking of the C terminus from a protein in CysE trimer into an CysK active site. This interaction inactivates CysK catalysis and also prevents further binding to the trimer.	Heterodecamer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0486"(UniProt)	P0A9D4(6)|P0ABK5(4)

The activity of the complex is allosterically regulated by the secondary messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c‐di‐GMP) which binds to both proteins, stabilizing and activating the complex.	 c‐di‐GMP binding to both PgaC and PgaD induces a conformational change that causes the integration of the two transmembrane helices of PgaD into a core of transmembrane domains formed by PgaC.

Part of a seven-subunit assembly that spans the cellular envelope. Extracts LPS from the outer leaflet of the inner membrane and provides the energy to drive its transport across the inner membrane, periplasm and into the outer membrane through an ATPase-dependent mechanism. The cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain of the lptB dimer hydrolyzes ATP to switch the substrate cavity of the transmembrane domains of the lptF/G dimer between inward- and outward-facing conformations. LPS then crosses the periplasm along a continuous hydrophobic groove formed by lptC (P0ADV9), lptA (P0ADV1) and lptD (P31554). The lptDE complex (CPX-1093) subsequently sorts LPS to the outer leaflet of the outer membrane.	lptC associates with lptBFG and LPS laterally enters the inner cavity of the complex where is is recognized through relatively weak interactions with the transmembrane domains (TMDs) TMDs of lptF, lptG abd lptC. The TMD of lptC then appears to dissociate from the interface and the TMDs rearrange to tightly bind LPS. ATP binding causes lptB dimerization and inward movement of the TMDs, which leads to the expulsion of LPS, a ‘lock and squeeze’ mechanism.

TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. higB is a probable translation-dependent mRNA interferase. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176), leaving the toxins to exert their effects which result in growth arrest and cell dormancy. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription, with TA complexes repressing transcription more efficiently than the antitoxins alone by increasing the co-operativity of antitoxin binding to operators. 	Each higB molecule forms a three anti-parallel beta-sheet core shielded by alpha-helices at either side. Each higA forms an alpha-helica C-shaped clamp which encompasses a higB in the (higBA)2 complex. HigA has an N-terminal dimerization domain, the higA C-terminal domain with a helix-turn-helix fold is required for DNA binding. higA undergoes drastic conformational changes upon the binding of higB achieved by rigid motions of N-terminal and C-terminal domains of higA around its central linker domain.

The recognition of lipoproteins by LolC and/or LolE occurs on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. LolD hydrolyses ATP on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane providing the driving force for the release reaction. Member of a small subclass of eukaryote-type (EK-type) ABC transporters that uses mechano-transmission to perform work in the periplasm rather than for transmembrane transport.	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that actively transport molecules across the lipid membrane against a concentration gradient, using the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP. Transmembrane-domain (TMD) containing proteins form the transport channel and consist of several membrane-spanning alpha-helices. Nucleotide binding domain (NBD) proteins bind and hydrolyse ATP inducing conformational changes in these proteins. EK-type ABC transporters are generally exporters, moving substances from the cytoplasm out of the cell and in some cases evolutionary modifications have led to gene fusion between the separate TMD and NBD component genes. ABC transporters generally have at least 10 transmembrane segments whereas both LolC and LolE span the membrane only 4 times giving 8 transmembrane segments and each have a large approximately 200 amino acids domain between the first and second transmembrane segments which is exposed to the periplasm. .

Member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, prokaryote-type (PK-type) subfamily. Population-based multi-cellularity, has been termed quorum sensing. Extracellular AI-2 activity peaks during the mid- to late-exponential phase and rapidly decreases during entry into the stationary phase. The disappearance of extracellular AI-2 activity is due to its import by this complex. 	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that actively transport molecules across the lipid membrane against a concentration gradient, using the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP. ABC transporters are composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) which are the integral membrane proteins and two nucleotide binding domain (NBDs) proteins associated with the TMDs on one side of the membrane. The TMDs form the transport channel and consist of several membrane-spanning alpha-helices. The NBDs bind and hydrolyse ATP. ATP binding induces conformational changes in the NBDs, forcing them into closer contact and forming the characteristic nucleotide sandwich dimer. This then causes a conformational change in the TMDs which results in the opening of the transport channel. The PK-type ABC transporters are importers that require additional periplasmic binding proteins to recruit substrates from the extracellular space and deliver them to the core transporter.

ATP binding induces conformational changes in the NBDs, forcing them into closer contact and forming the characteristic nucleotide sandwich dimer. This then causes a conformational change in the TMDs which results in the opening of the transport channel. The PK-type ABC transporters are importers that require additional periplasmic binding proteins to recruit substrates from the extracellular space and deliver them to the core transporter. Typically each component in PK-type ABC transporters is a separate protein, arising from an individual gene in an operon coding for the complete transporter.

ABC transporters are composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) which are the integral membrane proteins and two nucleotide binding domain (NBDs) proteins associated with the TMDs on one side of the membrane. The TMDs form the transport channel and consist of several membrane-spanning alpha-helices. The NBDs bind and hydrolyse ATP. ATP binding induces conformational changes in the NBDs, forcing them into closer contact and forming the characteristic nucleotide sandwich dimer. This then causes a conformational change in the TMDs which results in the opening of the transport channel. The PK-type ABC transporters are importers that require additional periplasmic binding proteins to recruit substrates from the extracellular space and deliver them to the core transporter. Typically each component in PK-type ABC transporters is a separate protein, arising from an individual gene in an operon coding for the complete transporter.

A conserved redox-active cysteine residue (Cys-47), the peroxidatic cysteine (C(P)), in the active site of one ahpC molecule is responsible for a nucleophilic attack on the peroxide substrate. The peroxide oxidizes the C(P)-SH to cysteine sulfenic acid (C(P)-SOH), which then reacts with another cysteine residue (Cys-166), the resolving cysteine (C(R)) located at the C-terminus of a second subunit of ahpC to form a disulfide bridge. Oxidized ahpC is regenerated by electron donation via the disulphide center (-CxxC-) in the N-terminal domain of ahpF, resulting in reduction of the ahpC cysteines to their thiol form using either NADH or NADPH as an electron donor.	The ahpF homodimer alternates between a compact and extended conformation. The compact form of ahpF facilitates intra-molecular electron transfer between the redox-active centres of the N-terminal domain and NADH-domain, the extended form is responsible for binding to the homodecameric ahpC ring through interactions with the flexible C-terminal tail of the oxidized ahpC. The decameric ring complex consists of five ahpC homodimers and dimeric ahpF appears to bind to the outer surface of the ahpC ring, bringing ahpF in close proximity to the redox active disulphide centres (Cys-47, Cys-166) of two adjacent ahpC molecules. Complex disassembly is driven by conformational changes at the active site and the C-terminal tail of ahpC after reduction.	Homododecamer	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0486"(UniProt)	P0AE08(10)|P35340(2)

In conditions such as nutrient starvation or oxidative stress, rpoS is believed to take over transcription of genes important for cell survival that are under rpoD control during faster growth.

The synapse of (XerCD-dif)2 is not catalytically competent; the presence of the DNA translocase ftsK (P46889) is required for cleavage to occur. xerC exchanges the top pair of DNA strands and xerD exchanges the bottom strands. Xer recombination also contributes to the segregational stability of a variety of natural multicopy plasmids by resolving multimeric forms arising from homologous recombination	xerC and xerD reciprocally control each other's catalytic activity through donor-acceptor interactions between the extreme C-terminal end of each protein. Interactions between xerC and xerD molecules bound on the same duplex force the DNA to bend in a configuration where the top strand of the recombination site central region is exposed toward the outside of the duplex. The torsion energy stored in the bent DNA may act on the xerC-xerD donor-acceptor interaction and activate xerC catalysis by repositioning of the tyrosine nucleophile with respect to the DNA target phosphate. Completion of the strand exchange reaction generates a 2-fold symmetric Holliday junction intermediate in which the top strands are crossing. Coupled protein and DNA conformation changes convert the complex into a configuration in which the bottom strands are crossing which leads to synchronized inactivation of the xerC subunits and concomitant activation of the xerD subunits.

The removal of these four-way DNA intermediates during late-stage recombination: is crucial for chromosome segregation. 	The RuvAB-Holliday junction complex is a dumbbell-shaped tripartite structure, in which ruvA is flanked by two oppositely oriented hexameric rings of ruvB. It is still unclear whether one or two ruvA tetramers bind to a junction with high affinity, and the two ruvB hexamers bind to opposing arms of the junction flanking the ruvA tetramer. The two ruvB motors rotate opposing arms of the open Holliday junction structure, effectively pumping DNA into and through the RuvAB complex, and, in doing so, convert homoduplex DNA into heteroduplex. The four acidic pins on ruvA act as guides that facilitate unwinding and strand exchange. ruvA stimulates the weak ATPase activity of ruvB in the presence of DNA, resulting in RuvB rotating the recombined strands while pulling them out of the junction, but not separating the strands.

The active alpha(2)beta(2) complex has a compact structure that can be reversibly converted via a dynamic conformational rearrangement to an inactive alpha(4)beta(4) state in the presence of elevated deoxyATP. The homodimeric alpha-2 subunit contains the active site, where ribonucleotide reduction occurs, and two types of allosteric effector binding sites. One effector site tunes the specificity for all four ribonucleotide substrates in response to intracellular levels of deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dATP, dTTP, dGTP) and ATP. The second effector site controls the rate of reduction, binding ATP to turn the enzyme on or dATP to turn it off, thus reducing enzyme activity through a negative feedback mechanism. The beta-2 subunit, nrdF, harbors the essential diferric-tyrosyl radical (Tyr-105) active site residue that initiates radical chemistry. The alpha(4)beta(4) complex induced by the negative effector, dATP, is a ring-like structure composed of alternating alpha(2) and beta(2) subunits.

The REase recognizes and cleaves foreign DNA sequences at specific sites, cleaving endonucleolytically at phosphodiester bonds to generate 5′ or 3′ overhangs or blunt ends while the MTase activity ensures discrimination between self and non-self DNA, by transferring methyl groups to the same specific DNA sequence within the host's genome. The complex binds to a bipartite, asymmetric DNA sequence, 5'-AACN6GTGC-3', the MTase transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to the C-5 carbon or the N4 amino group of cytosine or to the N6 amino group of adenine on newly replicated, hemimethylated host DNA and switches to an endonuclease activity on unmethylated foreign DNA, cleaving from approximately 100 base pairs to tens of thousands of base pairs away from the target. The latter reaction requires massive ATP hydrolysis to drive translocation of up to 50 kb of DNA at rates of up to 1 kb per second.

During elongation, the sigma factor is replaced by nupA and nupG binding to RNAP and enhances RNAP pausing at specific sites. nusA also binds to rRNA just downstream to the single stranded BOXA motif. nusB appears to enhance nusE binding to BOXA RNA and the RNA polymerase complex. NusG increases the RNA chain elongation rate.	The RNAP holoenzyme structure resembles a crab claw with two pincers that generating a cleft for template DNA entry into the enzyme active site, located at the bottom of the cleft. The rpoC subunit forms one pincer, the "clamp", and the rpoB subunit forms the other pincer. The clamp changes its position by moving between open and closed states. The formation of the rpoA dimer is the first step in RNAP biogenesis and it acts as a scaffold for assembling the two largest subunits rpoB and rpoC. One of the rpoA subunits binds only to the rpoB subunit while the second rpoA subunit largely contacts the rpoC subunit but also makes minor contacts with the rpoB subunit. The enzyme active site is formed by two double-psi beta-barrel domains, one from each of the rpoB and rpoC subunits. The NusABEG sub-complex is held together by relatively weak protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and assembles in a highly cooperative manner. The N-terminal domains of nusA and nusG anchor this to RNAP. The nusA and nusB are linked via binding to the adjacent RNA sequences in the upstream regions of rRNA genes. nusE simultaneously binds to nusB and nusG, blocking the Rho transcription termination factor (P0AG30) binding site on the nusG C-terminal domain and thereby inhibiting Rho-mediated termination.

ATPase activity of pspF is required to induce an open complex formation of the DNA‐bound RNA polymerase at its target promoters. The pspAF complex retains only a basal ATPase activity. Membrane stresses, such as the mislocalisation of proteins to the inner membrane, appear to lead to the recruitment of pspA to the pspBC complex (CPX-5892), enabling at least a partial release of pspA from pspF. This allows transcription of the Psp membrane-stabilizing system through binding of pspF to the sigma factor rpoN (P24255). 	pspA binds to the pspF hexamer and inhibits pspF activity by direct interaction of the AAA+ transcription activation domain of pspF. pspA appears to bind to Trp-56 of pspF. This is part of the 50-62 aa loop which contains a group of three amino acids, called the YLW patch, that serve as a docking site for pspA and for ATP hydrolytic activity.

TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence, with the toxin causing growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, such as transcription, translation or DNA replication, and the cognate antitoxin neutralizing the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Formation of this complex dissociates the CcdB-poisoned gyrase complex (CPX-5906) in a process called rejuvenation. The CcdAB complex also acts as a repressor of the ccd operon.	ccdA binds consecutively to two partially overlapping sites on ccdB. When ccdB is in complex with gyrA (P0AES4), a large portion of the ccdA residue 37-72-binding surface is shielded and only the ccdA 65-72 segment can access its binding site. Binding of this segment induces a conformational change in ccdB, releasing it from gryA. The ccdA 37-63 segment then locks onto ccdB with the complex forming a chain of alternating ccdA2 and ccdB2 dimers. A ccdA:2xccdB2 trimer may also form and appears to be sufficient for rejuvenation, a 2xccdA:ccdB4 complex which lacks corepressor activity may also exist.

SeqA forms filaments on methylated and hemimethylated DNA but has a higher avidity for hemimethylated GATC sites. Hemimethylated DNA is created during complementary strand synthesis before Dam protein fully methylates the new stand. Binding of SeqA to hemimethylated DNA sequesters the chromosomal replication origin, oriC, preventing re-methylation of DNA by Dam and in turn stopping premature re-initiation of replication during one replication cycle. Depletion of the SeqA pool towards the end of the replication cycle allows Dam protein to displace SeqA from the hemimethylated DNA, allowing it to fully methylate the DNA and initiate a new cycle of DNA replication. The SeqA-DNA complex travels with the replication folk sequentially binding to the majority of hemimethylated GATC sites of the newly-synthesized dsDNA. SeqA can form multimers consisting of dimers, tetramers octamers and higher order filaments but it is believed that the main form in vivo are filaments.

The binding of ATP and its subsequent hydrolysis by hslU are essential for unfolding of protein substrates subsequently hydrolyzed by hslV. hslU recognizes the N-terminal part of its protein substrates and unfolds these before they are guided to hslV for hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis causes a conformational change in the hslU subunit 'closing' the central pore and 'un-docking' the ATPase unit from the protease by way of flicking the hslU C-terminus from the hslV-hslV interface into the hslU-hslU interface. The complex has been shown to be involved in the specific degradation of heat shock induced transcription factors such as rpoH and sulA. In addition, small hydrophobic peptides are also hydrolyzed by hslV. hslV has weak protease activity even in the absence of hslU, but this activity is induced more than 100-fold in the presence of hslU.

Member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, prokaryote-type (PK-type) subfamily. 	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that actively transport molecules across the lipid membrane against a concentration gradient, using the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP. ABC transporters are composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) which are the integral membrane proteins and two nucleotide binding domain (NBDs) proteins associated with the TMDs on one side of the membrane. The TMDs form the transport channel and consist of several membrane-spanning alpha-helices. The NBDs bind and hydrolyse ATP. ATP binding induces conformational changes in the NBDs, forcing them into closer contact and forming the characteristic nucleotide sandwich dimer. This then causes a conformational change in the TMDs which results in the opening of the transport channel. The PK-type ABC transporters are importers that require additional periplasmic binding proteins to recruit substrates from the extracellular space and deliver them to the core transporter. Typically each component in PK-type ABC transporters is a separate protein, arising from an individual gene in an operon coding for the complete transporter.

Protein folding is initiated by a conformational shift within the GroEL-GroES complex.

Responsible for the regulation of cell volume by translocating solutes across the plasma membrane. The proVWX operon is activated under osmotic stress conditions and the complex itself is regulated by osmotic stress, presumably via an increase in the internal salt concentration .	ABC transporters are composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) which are the integral membrane proteins and two nucleotide binding domain (NBDs) proteins associated with the TMDs on one side of the membrane. The TMDs form the transport channel and consist of several membrane-spanning alpha-helices. The NBDs bind and hydrolyse ATP. ATP binding induces conformational changes in the NBDs, forcing them into closer contact and forming the characteristic nucleotide sandwich dimer. This then causes a conformational change in the TMDs which results in the opening of the transport channel. The PK-type ABC transporters are importers that require additional periplasmic binding proteins to recruit substrates from the extracellular space and deliver them to the core transporter. Typically each component in PK-type ABC transporters is a separate protein, arising from an individual gene in an operon coding for the complete transporter.

Member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, prokaryote-type (PK-type) subfamily. sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, a degradation product of phospholipids, is utilized as a source of carbon and phosphate under starvation conditions.	ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that actively transport molecules across the lipid membrane against a concentration gradient, using the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP. ABC transporters are composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) which are the integral membrane proteins and two nucleotide binding domain (NBDs) proteins associated with the TMDs on one side of the membrane. The TMDs form the transport channel and consist of several membrane-spanning alpha-helices. The NBDs bind and hydrolyse ATP. ATP binding induces conformational changes in the NBDs, forcing them into closer contact and forming the characteristic nucleotide sandwich dimer. This then causes a conformational change in the TMDs which results in the opening of the transport channel. The PK-type ABC transporters are importers that require additional periplasmic binding proteins to recruit substrates from the extracellular space and deliver them to the core transporter. Typically each component in PK-type ABC transporters is a separate protein, arising from an individual gene in an operon coding for the complete transporter.

Sideraphore transport requires an outer membrane receptor (fhuA), which is relatively specific for its ligand. The ligand-bound receptor then physically interacts with the TonB protein. TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through TBDTs requires interaction with tonB in complex with exbB and exbD in the inner membrane, ExbBD. TonB undergoes rapid energized movement driven by ExbBD which harvests the electrochemical force from the electrochemical proton gradient created by the proton gradient across the inner membrane and convert it into rotational motion. Hence, TonB may pull or twist the N-termini of TBDTs to promote transport of substrates into the periplasm. ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters subsequently move the ferrichrome (Fe3+) through the periplasm and inner membrane. Also transports the antibiotic albomycin, a structural analog of ferrichrome, and acts as a receptor for colicin M, microcin J25 and bacteriophages T1, T5, phi80 and UC-1 	The lumen of fhuA, a 22-stranded beta-barrel outer membrane protein, is blocked by an N-terminal plug, or cork, domain preventing passive transit of ferrichrome. The binding of ferrichrome induces an allosteric rearrangement of the plug domain, releasing a conserved motif, the Ton-box into the periplasmic space, where it forms a 1:1 complex. The transmembrane helix at the N-terminus of TonB forms a complex with exbB and exbD, which form the proton channel that energizes uptake through TonB. Pentameric and hexameric exbB complexes coexist in detergent micelles and within lipid bilayers, and the ratio of the hexamer to the pentamer increases with pH, similar to the pH dependence of the macroscopic channel conductance. This, and the channel volume of the respective assemblies suggests that the pentamer is less active and the hexamer more active.

The fimbria consists of a 1-2 um long fimbrial rod, built by thousands of copies of the non-adhesive major subunit, FimA (P04128). The tip is optimized to have a dual functionality: flexible exploration and force sensing. The FimFGH subunits interact through donor strand complementation where a beta-strand from one subunit completes the beta-sandwich structure of the neighboring subunit. FimH contains a lectin domain which binds mannose derivatives on the surface of neighboring cells. 	The mannose-binding lectin domain of the apex-positioned adhesive protein FimH is docked to the anchoring pilin domain in a distinct hook. The hooked conformation is highly stable under no force conditions but allows an easy separation of the domains upon application of force, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low- to a high-affinity state. The conformation between the FimH pilin domain and the adjacent FimG subunit of the tip is open and stable even when force is applied, providing an extended lever arm for the hook unhinging under shear. The conformation between FimG and FimF subunits is highly flexible even in the absence of force, allowing lateral and rotational flexibility to efficiently explore target surfaces.

ClpP on its own can degrade only small peptides (<5 amino acids) or full-length unfolded proteins with low efficiency and requires association to the ClpA or ClpX ATPases to efficiently process larger peptides and folded proteins. In the absence of the ATPase complex, ClpP is assumed to be in a closed conformation.

The first half-reaction catalyzed by biotin carboxylase, is an ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin, which is covalently attached to biotin carboxyl carrier protein. The second half-reaction, catalyzed by carboxyl transferase, transfers the activated carboxyl group from carboxy-biotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA.	Interactions among the components of the functional complex are weak, and upon cell lysis, they readily dissociate into stable carboxyl transferase and biotin carboxylase components plus a metastable complex of a biotin carboxylase dimer with four biotin carboxyl carrier protein molecules.
